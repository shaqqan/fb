# League CRUD Update: Hierarchical Support Added! 🏗️

## 🎉 **Major Enhancement: Parent-Child League Relationships!**

The League management system has been significantly enhanced to support hierarchical organization with parent-child relationships, creating a powerful tree structure for organizing competitions and leagues.

### 🔄 **What Changed:**

#### **1. Entity Structure Enhanced**
The `League` entity now includes:
```typescript
@ManyToOne(() => League)
@JoinColumn({ name: 'parentLeagueId' })
parentLeague: League;

@OneToMany(() => League, (league) => league.parentLeague)  
childLeagues: League[];

@OneToMany(() => Club, (club) => club.league)
clubs: Club[];
```

#### **2. DTO Updates**
- **`CreateLeagueDto`** - Added optional `parentLeagueId` field
- **`UpdateLeagueDto`** - Inherits `parentLeagueId` as optional field
- **Full validation** with `class-validator` decorators

#### **3. Service Layer Enhancements**
**New Methods Added:**
- ✅ `getChildren(id)` - Get all child leagues
- ✅ `getParent(id)` - Get parent league (or null)
- ✅ `getRootLeagues(query)` - Get top-level leagues (paginated)
- ✅ `getHierarchy(id)` - Get complete hierarchy context
- ✅ `wouldCreateCircularReference()` - Prevent infinite loops
- ✅ `getAllDescendants()` - Recursive descendant discovery

**Enhanced Existing Methods:**
- ✅ `create()` - Validates parent league existence
- ✅ `getAll()` - Loads parent/child relationships + filtering
- ✅ `getById()` - Includes parent, children, and clubs
- ✅ `update()` - Circular reference prevention + parent validation
- ✅ `remove()` - Cascade protection (prevents deletion with children/clubs)

#### **4. Controller Layer Expansion**
**4 New REST Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /leagues/roots` - Root leagues (paginated)
- ✅ `GET /leagues/:id/children` - Child leagues
- ✅ `GET /leagues/:id/parent` - Parent league
- ✅ `GET /leagues/:id/hierarchy` - Full hierarchy

**Enhanced Existing Endpoints:**
- ✅ All endpoints now handle hierarchical data
- ✅ New filtering option: `filter.parentLeagueId`
- ✅ Complete Swagger documentation

### 🚀 **11 Total League Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth | Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|----------|
| **POST** | `/leagues` | Create league (with optional parent) | ✅ Required | 201 + League |
| **GET** | `/leagues` | List all leagues (with hierarchy) | ❌ Public | 200 + Paginated |
| **GET** | `/leagues/roots` | List root leagues only | ❌ Public | 200 + Paginated |
| **GET** | `/leagues/:id` | Get league by ID (with relations) | ❌ Public | 200 + League |
| **GET** | `/leagues/:id/children` | Get child leagues | ❌ Public | 200 + Array |
| **GET** | `/leagues/:id/parent` | Get parent league | ❌ Public | 200 + League\|null |
| **GET** | `/leagues/:id/hierarchy` | Get full hierarchy (3 levels) | ❌ Public | 200 + League |
| **PATCH** | `/leagues/:id` | Update league (move in hierarchy) | ✅ Required | 200 + League |
| **DELETE** | `/leagues/:id` | Delete league (with protection) | ✅ Required | 200 + Message |

### 🏗️ **Hierarchical Features:**

#### **🔒 Smart Validations:**

1. **Circular Reference Prevention**
   ```bash
   # This will fail if League 5 is a descendant of League 3
   PATCH /api/v1/leagues/3
   { "parentLeagueId": 5 }
   # Error: "Cannot set league 5 as parent: would create a circular reference"
   ```

2. **Cascade Protection**
   ```bash
   # Cannot delete if has children
   DELETE /api/v1/leagues/1
   # Error: "Cannot delete league: it has 3 child league(s)"
   
   # Cannot delete if has clubs
   DELETE /api/v1/leagues/5  
   # Error: "Cannot delete league: it has 12 club(s)"
   ```

3. **Parent Validation**
   ```bash
   # Parent must exist
   POST /api/v1/leagues
   { "parentLeagueId": 999 }
   # Error: "Parent league with ID 999 not found"
   ```

#### **🎯 Advanced Querying:**

**Filter by Parent:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/leagues?filter.parentLeagueId=1
# Get all leagues under league #1
```

**Get Root Leagues Only:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/leagues/roots?page=1&limit=10
# Only top-level leagues (no parents)
```

**Full Hierarchy with Context:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/leagues/5/hierarchy
# Returns league #5 with:
# - Parent league (and grandparent)
# - Child leagues (and grandchildren)  
# - Clubs belonging to this league
```

### 🏆 **Example Use Case: UEFA Structure**

#### **Create Hierarchy:**
```json
// 1. Create root league
POST /api/v1/leagues
{
  "title": { "en": "UEFA Competitions" },
  "logo": "/uploads/uefa.png"
}
// Response: { "id": 1, ... }

// 2. Create child league
POST /api/v1/leagues  
{
  "title": { "en": "Champions League" },
  "logo": "/uploads/ucl.png",
  "parentLeagueId": 1
}
// Response: { "id": 2, "parentLeague": { "id": 1 } }

// 3. Create sub-competition
POST /api/v1/leagues
{
  "title": { "en": "Group Stage" },
  "logo": "/uploads/ucl-groups.png", 
  "parentLeagueId": 2
}
// Response: { "id": 3, "parentLeague": { "id": 2 } }
```

#### **Query Structure:**
```bash
# Get all UEFA competitions
GET /api/v1/leagues/1/children
# Returns: [Champions League, Europa League, Conference League]

# Get Champions League stages  
GET /api/v1/leagues/2/children
# Returns: [Group Stage, Knockout Stage]

# Get complete UEFA hierarchy
GET /api/v1/leagues/1/hierarchy
# Returns full tree with all levels
```

#### **Manage Hierarchy:**
```json
// Move Europa League under different parent
PATCH /api/v1/leagues/4
{
  "parentLeagueId": 5  // Move to different organization
}

// Make Champions League a root competition
PATCH /api/v1/leagues/2
{
  "parentLeagueId": null  // Remove from UEFA, make independent
}
```

#### **Root Leagues (Paginated):**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": { "en": "UEFA Competitions" },
      "childLeagues": [/* child leagues */],
      "clubs": [/* clubs */]
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "title": { "en": "FIFA Competitions" },
      "childLeagues": [/* child leagues */],
      "clubs": [/* clubs */]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "itemsPerPage": 10,
    "totalItems": 2,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  },
  "links": { /* pagination links */ }
}
```

### 🔄 **Migration Impact:**

#### **Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ **Existing leagues remain unchanged** (they become root leagues)
- ✅ **All existing endpoints work** (enhanced with new data)
- ✅ **Optional parentLeagueId** doesn't break existing API calls
- ✅ **Gradual adoption** - can add hierarchy incrementally

#### **Database Changes:**
- ✅ **New column:** `parentLeagueId` (nullable foreign key)
- ✅ **Self-referencing relationship** added
- ✅ **Club-League relationship** maintained

### 💡 **Business Benefits:**

1. **Real-World Modeling** - Accurately represents sports organization structures
2. **Flexible Organization** - Leagues can be reorganized without data loss  
3. **Scalable Architecture** - Supports unlimited hierarchy depth
4. **Data Integrity** - Prevents invalid relationships and orphaned data
5. **Query Efficiency** - Optimized joins for hierarchical queries
6. **API Consistency** - Follows RESTful patterns with intuitive endpoints

### ⚡ **Performance Optimizations:**

- **Eager Loading** - Related entities loaded efficiently with joins
- **Pagination** - All list endpoints support pagination
- **Query Optimization** - Recursive queries limited to prevent infinite loops
- **Caching Ready** - Structured responses suitable for caching strategies

### 🎯 **Use Cases Enabled:**
